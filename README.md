### MS365 for File Management: OneDrive and SharePoint
OneDrive and SharePoint are part of the Microsoft 365 family of products (formerly known as Office 365). This suite includes cloud-based tools and services designed to enhance productivity, collaboration, and data management across organizations.

- OneDrive:  
A personal cloud storage service that allows users to store, sync, and share files securely. It's tightly integrated with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, and Teams.

- SharePoint:  
A collaborative platform used for document management, intranet portals, and team sites. It enables organizations to manage content, knowledge, and applications to empower teamwork.

Both tools work together to support seamless file sharing and collaboration, especially within Microsoft Teams and Outlook.
